Steam Achievement GUI

Graphical User Interface for Steam Achievements. Relies on Koraktor Steam Condenser Library to pull data from the web. (https://github.com/koraktor/steam-condenser)

The basis of this program was to design a GUI that was well designed, easy to use, and visually appealing.

The back-end of the software, while mostly functional was not focused on, and only serves as a proof of concept for a desktop application.
